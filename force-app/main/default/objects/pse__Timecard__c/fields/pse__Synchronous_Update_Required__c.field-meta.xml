    <description>This checkbox is for system use.  It is intended to be checked in conjunction with any insert/update of the Timecard Split executed within a future method, and will then ensure that no downstream future methods are called.  In Salesforce, a future method can&apos;t call another future method.  Triggers should then unset this checkbox so that it never remains checked persistently.

Danger:  only check this flag for changes NOT on the &quot;critical&quot; path with respect to governor limits.  For example, it is ok to check this flag if the only change to the Timecard Split is to modify the Billed/Invoiced flags and the Billing Event Item lookup value.</description>
