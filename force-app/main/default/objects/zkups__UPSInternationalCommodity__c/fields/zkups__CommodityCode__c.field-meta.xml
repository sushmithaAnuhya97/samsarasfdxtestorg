    <description>Tariff codes are defined by customs authorities and used to classify products. Customs uses tariff codes to determine what duties will be payable on products. It is therefore important that the correct code is identified. Using the right code means that you will not be liable for excess customs duties or assessments. The standard harmonized tariff code is a six-digit code, though some contain more digits. The tariff code is unique for the product and its destination.</description>
