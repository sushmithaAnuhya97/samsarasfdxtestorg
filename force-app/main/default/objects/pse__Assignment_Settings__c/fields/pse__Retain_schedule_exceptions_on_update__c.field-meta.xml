    <description>If deselected, when a schedule&apos;s date range is changed, schedule exceptions that are partly or wholly outside the schedule&apos;s date range are deleted.

If selected, when a schedule&apos;s date range is changed, schedule exceptions that are wholly outside the schedule&apos;s date range are deleted. Schedule exceptions that are partly outside the schedule&apos;s date range are shortened to fit within the new schedule date range.</description>
