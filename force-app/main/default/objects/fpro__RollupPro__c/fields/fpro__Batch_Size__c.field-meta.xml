    <description>Enter the batch size to split the &quot;records to update&quot; into smaller groups for processing (e.g., a batch size of 100 splits 2000 records into 20 batches/Apex transactions). This helps reduce the risk of hitting Salesforce governor limits by spreading the workload across multiple transactions. If left blank, all records will be processed in a single Apex transaction, which may increase the chance of exceeding limits. Choose a value based on the job&apos;s complexity and system constraints.</description>
